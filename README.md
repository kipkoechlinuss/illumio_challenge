In the Class Firewall, it takes in a CSV file as an input and in the function openandcheck()this is where i open the file and check for the firewall rules i.e direction, ports, protocol and ip should match the set rules.
In the function parse_range i handle the cases where am given port range or ip range. I parse the input to separate the two parts of the input e.g 2334-3455 will be put in a list of the form [2334,3455]
I had a few challenges doing this problem. First, i could not write unit test because i ran into issues when installing them on my new computer and i had limited time to finish this challenge.
I am however confident i would have done better with more time and less pressure. 
If possible I would like to talk with one of the engineers to evaluate my skills because i believe i have the skills which i could not really demonstrate during this coding challenge. 
Otherwise thanks.
